# Cats Wall Art

A small SwiftUI project using the Rive iOS runtime to showcase [dynamically loading](https://help.rive.app/runtimes/loading-assets) in cat images within Rive graphics. In this example, we load in dynamic cat images (from our main bundle) within animated picture frames on a "wall"/screen. It links swipe gestures to state machine inputs and uses [Rive Events](https://help.rive.app/runtimes/rive-events) to trigger swapping out of image assets dynamically, while caching previous image results.
